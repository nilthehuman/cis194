# CIS 194 Homework Solutions

This repo is a backup of my solutions to the homework exercises in Brent
Yorgey's classic introductory Haskell class "[CIS 194][1]". I'm not a University
of Pennsylvania student, I'm just teaching myself Haskell in my free time.

The repository is public for no other reason that I don't pay GitHub
for private repos. But if you find any of it useful, hey, I'm glad I helped
someone. :)
